# Radix

An attempt to implement the Radix protocol as described by https://www.radixdlt.com/. 

This repo is currently extremely out of date. I'm in the process of completely rewriting it, but my p2p networking project is taking up the majority of my time, so until that's a bit more mature, this project is on the backburner.
